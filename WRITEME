This a second file in which it's possible to do a lot of stuff and I think this could be function that is used by README.

This is new.

I cannot commit anymore on PyCharm (where is the GitHub part in PyCharm?)

Wow, I was wrong all along. You can always commit from GitHub Desktop.

Just adding and extra here to see if my GitHub Desktop compares with the last commit or the origin file.
